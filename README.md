# PerceptualGAN++: Enhancing Image Generation with GANs

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized image generation tasks, but designing perceptually aware GANs that align closely with human visual perception remains a significant challenge. Traditional GANs often optimize for pixel-wise accuracy, leading to perceptual artifacts and a lack of semantic coherence.

**PerceptualGAN++** is a novel framework that integrates perceptual decision-making principles and insights from neural mechanisms like brain oscillations to improve image generation. This approach enhances perceptual fidelity while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Progressive Adversarial Training**: Stabilizes learning for more robust convergence.
- **Multi-Scale Feature Alignment**: Improves perceptual quality by aligning features across different scales.
- **Adaptive Texture Matching Loss**: Dynamically adjusts to high-frequency content for realistic textures.
- **Confidence-Weighted Training**: Enhances region-specific perceptual accuracy.
- **Perceptual Loss Functions**: Incorporates human vision-based losses to improve semantic consistency.

## Installation

To use **PerceptualGAN++**, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PerceptualGAN.git
cd PerceptualGAN
pip install -r requirements.txt
